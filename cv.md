> a hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive? Return true if yes, false otherwise

``` function hero(bullets, dragons) {
   	if (bullets - (dragons * 2) >= 0)
   	  return true;
   	else
   	  return false;
   }
